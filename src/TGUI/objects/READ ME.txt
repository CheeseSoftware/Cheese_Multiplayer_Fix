This might look very difficult, but it should become clear when looking at the example objects that are included with TGUI.


All objects (except Picture and Listbox) are loaded with a pathname.

The folder must contain the necessary images and perhaps some optional images.
All the images are case sensitive and must start with a capital letter followed by lowercase letters.
There are two exceptions:
 * If SplitImage is true then before these names you must add L_, M_ and R_.
 * After an underscore (needed in Scrollbar), you must write anothr capital letter.

Every folder must have a file called "info.txt" with information about the object.
It may be empty (then the default options will be used) but the file must exist.
Spaces and tabs are ignored in the file and to add comments you can put a # in the line.

The info file can contain the following:

- Extension:         What is the extension of the image files? The default is png.

- Phases:            Which optional images are there? Depending on the object this can be
                     Hover, Focus and Down. The object can't be focused if there is no focus image.
                     Button is the only object that can have down; Scrollbar can only have hover.
                     Not used by LoadingBar.

- SplitImage:        If the object exists of multiple images then this should be true.
                     Normally you don't need this option. You will only need it if you want to use 
                     one image while having objects with a completely different width.
                     Button, EditBox and LoadingBar only.

- TextColor:         The color of the text that is drawn on top of a button or next to a checkbox.
                     An example value would be: (100, 50, 100).
                     If not provided, the text (if any) will be black.
                     Not used by Scrollbar and LoadingBar.

- SelectedTextColor: The color of the selected text.
                     EditBox only.

- SelectedTextBackgroundColor: The background color of the selected text.
                               EditBox only.

- UnfocusedSelectedTextBackgroundColor: The background color of the selected text, when the
                                        EditBox is unfocused.

- VerticalScroll:     If true then the image lies vertical (default), otherwise the image
                      lies horizontal.
                      Scrollbar and Slider only.
